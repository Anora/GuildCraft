Notes on GuildCraft and what it should accomplish/have

GuildCraft is based on the popular MMO GuildWars but implements only small aspects from it like the
Ore and some crafting based things.

    EnderIO                 to be implemented
    MineFactory Reloaded    to be implemented (porting in progress)
    Thaumcraft              Undesided
    
WoldGen    					partialy done or needs tweaking
	
own API						to be implemented
    
The things listed above are the things I have planed so far.

geine:
things that I would like to happen for the boss is that it must be summoned via some kind of retual 
or crafting object in the world must be captured by the primary means from the mod it self or can 
be captured using sould jars from EnderIO or the Safary net from MineFactory Reloaded(if its ported)
If he is kild instaid He will 100% always drop a Mystic Stone or captured he is to be used whit 
the Mystic Forge
    Aditional note:
    to caputure the boss his health will need to be below 50% and only a Mystic sword or Mystick Bow
    can damig the boss

Mystic Forge:
How I would like this to work is pretty simmilar to how the one in GuildWars 2 works, put in 4 items
randomly or specific and get an out put (right combination chance of better version, special 
combination = legendary item. No of these items will be from the game but all item's from Minecraft
or its mods depending on implementation
  
Helmet of Revealing:
Must remove void fog upong waring and can show nodes as well is made of dragonite  
  
Mobs:
All mobs will have standard drop rates on Minecraft items or moded items they can wild, but will have a
low chance of droping a mystic stone(will be the first way to get one) as you will need a to craft a
Mystic sword or a Mystic bow
